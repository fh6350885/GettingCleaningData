# Apology
* I was running out of time and there were some issues with my git, so I didnt push everything 
* to the repo before the deadline

* here I push both Codebook.md and run_analysis.R to the repo for your conveinience. Please Note that both 
* files were submmitted after due time. 

* Among the three files (readme, run_analysis and codebook). only the README.md is submmitted before the due. 
* However, this readme.md contains everything in codebook and run_analysis. I just didnt have enough time to 
* push them to git. Again I pologize for that
