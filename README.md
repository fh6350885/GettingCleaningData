# Getting and Cleaning Data Course Project
## Project Description
*the code combines the samples from "test" files and "train" files (each one of them is composed of X_train,y_train, and subject)
*the only the mean and std value were extracted out from the generated data frame
*the names of column have to be changed to subject, activity, and associated measurement names
*the name codes of activities were changed from 1,2,3,4,5,6 to walking, walking_up... blabla
*the final should be written into a txt file, with averaged value for each section (e.g: each subject in one activity). I havent finished the "taking average" step yet


## Codebook
*Subject column: 
* 1
* 2
* 3
* 4
* 5

* 7
* ...
* 30
* means the different subjects (different person)

* 2: walking upstair
* 3: walking downstair
* 4: sitting
* 5: standing
* 6: laying


* acitivies measurement 
* the mean and average of 
* tBodyAcc-mean()-X
* tBodyAcc-mean()-Y
* tBodyAcc-mean()-Z
* tBodyAcc-std()-X
* tBodyAcc-std()-Y
* and etc 
* tBodyAcc-std()-Z
